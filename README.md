# Cube Carnage

## Dead Kitten Games: Omar Naranjo Caprachi & Adrián Sobrado García

**Cube Carnage** is a game where you must survive wave after wave of zombies
coming for you in an arena, using a wide range of weapons and explosives.
It's a **minimalistic-style, arcade game** where the objective is to stand
as long as possible and enjoy the carnage in the meantime.

The game tries to simplify the zombie modes of other moder games such as
Call of Duty, which usually are as popular as the "normal" mode or even more.
It will feature **various arenas** with walls and explosive barrels for an
extra tactical level, and also **different weapons** for your choice (Rifle, 
shotgun and grenades, more to come).

The top-down view allows you to see the **huge amount of enemies** coming from
all directions and enjoy the effects of the explosions better. You will 
control your character using the arrow keys and the spacebar so its
really easy to play!.

Zombies are (by now) the only enemy in the game, who will mindlessly chase
the player trying to devour his brain before he **turns them into a bloody
paste in the floor**. The longer the player survives, the more zombies will come.

There is no way to win the game. The objective, as in most of the classic
arcades, is to obtain the **highest score** by slaying zombies before being
overrun. You will see your record score at the end of the game.
